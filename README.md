# Image Face-Centric Cropper

This application processes images by identifying faces and ensuring they remain central in the final output. It first crops the image to maximize the surrounding region while keeping the face at the center. The cropped image is then resized to a standard 
1024Ã—1024 resolution, ensuring the face remains undistorted and prominent. Ideal for creating consistent profile pictures or avatars from a collection of photographs.
